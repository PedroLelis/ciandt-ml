    "\n",

This split is very important: it's essential in machine learning that we have separate data which we don't learn from so that we can make sure that what we've learned actually generalizes!\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned earlier, every MNIST data point has two parts: an image of a handwritten digit and a corresponding label. We'll call the images \"x\" and the labels \"y\". Both the training set and test set contain images and their corresponding labels; for example the training images are mnist.train.images and the training labels are mnist.train.labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each image is 28 pixels by 28 pixels. We can interpret this as a big array of numbers:\n",

    "\n",
    "The result is that mnist.train.images is a tensor (an n-dimensional array) with a shape of [55000, 784]. The first dimension is an index into the list of images and the second dimension is the index for each pixel in each image. Each entry in the tensor is a pixel intensity between 0 and 1, for a particular pixel in a particular image.\n",

    "For the purposes of this tutorial, we're going to want our labels as \"one-hot vectors\". A one-hot vector is a vector which is 0 in most dimensions, and 1 in a single dimension. In this case, the n-th digit will be represented as a vector which is 1 in the n-th dimension. For example, 3 would be [0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Consequently, mnist.train.labels is a [55000, 10] array of floats.\n",
